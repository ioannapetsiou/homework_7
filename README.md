# Homework 7

My submission for homework 7
**Homework 7** includes two jupyter notebooks:

**Dataset ONE - Beer Cans** where I had to work with craftcans.csv, that I turned into a dataframe with info for beer

**Dataset TWO - Dogs** where I had to work with NYC_Dogs_Licenses_Current_as_of_4-28-2016.xlsx on dogs. Then this dataset was merged with boro_population.csv and zipcodes-neighborhoods.csv
